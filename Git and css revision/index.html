        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>AI chatbots are improving mobile app experiences.</p>
        <p>AI chatbots are becoming an important part of modern mobile applications. They help businesses communicate with users in a faster and more effective way. Instead of waiting for human support, users can get instant answers to their questions through chatbots. This improves user satisfaction and makes mobile apps more interactive and easy to use.
        Chatbots are powered by artificial intelligence, which allows them to understand user queries and respond in a smart manner. They can guide users, solve basic problems, and provide useful information at any time of the day. Because of this, mobile apps can offer 24/7 support without increasing costs.
        In addition, AI chatbots help businesses save time and resources. They reduce the workload of customer support teams and allow companies to focus on more important tasks. Overall, AI chatbots enhance the user experience, increase engagement, and play a key role in the success of modern mobile applications.</p>

        <h2 id="chatbots">AI Chatbots in Mobile Apps</h2>
        <p>They provide instant and automated support.</p>
        <p>AI chatbots are widely used in mobile applications to provide instant and automated support to users. They help users by answering common questions, guiding them through app features, and solving basic problems without any delay. This makes mobile apps more user-friendly and efficient.
        One of the biggest advantages of AI chatbots is that they are available 24/7. Users can get help anytime, even outside business hours. Chatbots can handle multiple users at the same time, which reduces waiting time and improves the overall experience of the app.
        AI chatbots also help businesses by reducing customer support costs. Since chatbots can manage routine queries automatically, human staff can focus on more complex issues. As a result, mobile apps become smarter, faster, and more reliable for users.</p>
